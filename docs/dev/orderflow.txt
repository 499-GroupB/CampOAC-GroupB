Order page should have several states (Prop)

Initially should present pickup location options showing stock available (API call to location)

User should be able to click the location they wish to order from

That gets passed and this.state.location is set
That will also be used in the form submit where location can be set to this.state.location

This will also modify the max stock a user can order from the form

Order should be timestamped as well so they can be dated and fulfilled accordingly.
    in schema {timestamps: true}
    this gives doc.createdAt and doc.updatedAt
