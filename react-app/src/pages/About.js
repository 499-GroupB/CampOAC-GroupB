            <h1>Welcome to Camp OAC!</h1>
            
            <p>

            Camp Owaissi is a childrens summer camp located just north
             of Kelowna on the beautiful Okanagan lake! Started in 1950,
              Camp Owaissi has ran summer camps that have been attended
               by thousands of campers. In the Offseason, the amazing property
                is available for rentals to host family reunions, get togethers
                 and even weddings. We also host school group rentals. 
                 Camp Owaissi is a place that everyone can enjoy.

            <p>We are currently doing the fundraisers to raise
            money for the new craft hut and to support camper bursaries. 
            We believe that all youth in our community should have the 
            opportunity to experience summer camp! </p>

            <h3> Firewood Fundraiser</h3>

            <p>
            We have partnered with the Rotary Club of Kelowna
            Ogopogo to sell firewood. Stay tuned for more information
            in the spring.
