            <p>We are currently doing the following fundraisers to raise
            money for the new craft hut and to support camper bursaries. 
            We believe that all youth in our community should have the 
            opportunity to experience summer camp! </p>

            <h3> Firewood Fundraiser</h3>

            <p>
            We have partnered with the Rotary Club of Kelowna
            Ogopogo to sell firewood. Stay tuned for more information
            in the spring.
