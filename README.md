## About

We are developing a mobile-friendly website to help the general public obtain
campfire wood. The user will select the location (from a list of available locations)
and the desired number of bags of firewood on the website. Then, they will receive an email
with an invoice generated based on the pricing and quantity ordered. The website then processes
payment or retains an invoice for cash payment at pick-up time. The receipt is automatically generated.
Users groups include local residents as well as tourists, most people who need a smaller quantity of wood
as for larger orders people would be more likely to turn to a bulk supplier.
